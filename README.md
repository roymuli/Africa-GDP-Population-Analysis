# Africa-GDP-Population-Analysis
This is a project that intends to investigate the changes of population and the implication to the GDP of African countries. However, my main focus is kenya
Despite robust GDP growth in Kenya over the past decade, rapid population expansion, high youth unemployment, and persistent income inequality continue to pose significant challenges to achieving inclusive economic development. This analysis aims to examine the relationship between population growth and economic growth in Kenya, focusing on the key sectors contributing to GDP, the impact of a youthful population on employment, and the barriers to sustainable development in rural and urban areas. By identifying critical gaps in human capital development, employment opportunities, and income distribution, this study seeks to provide insights for policies aimed at fostering long-term economic resilience and social equity.
